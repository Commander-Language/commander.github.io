                    I’m a student at the University of Utah. I’m graduating in May
                    2024 with a BS degree in Computer Science and a minor in
                    Mathematics. I’ve been working as an intern (and will soon be a
                    full-time engineer) at a smallish IT company known as TriVir. I
                    have a lot of experience programming, beginning all the way back
                    when I was 14 years old. I’ve worked on many projects since
                    then. Big projects I’ve worked on include a self-solving 3D
                    Rubik’s Cube program, the Commander Language project (my school
                    capstone project), Frodo (ForgeROck DO, an open source project),
                    and many other big projects I’ve worked on for various clients
                    while working at TriVir. <br><br>

                    Besides my interests in programming, I’m also interested in
                    science, math, gaming, and puzzles, with my main hobby being
                    gaming. I’m also an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ
                    of Latter-day Saints, and served a mission for the church from
                    June 2019 to April 2021 in Quito, Ecuador and Virginia, USA. As
                    such, I’m fluent in the Spanish language. <br><br>

                    I plan on working as a software engineer after I graduate. I may
                    go on to graduate school if I find an area I’m particularly
                    interested in studying. My ultimate goal is to eventually become
                    a freelance programmer/indie dev so I may have the freedom to
                    work on whatever project I want to.<br><br>
