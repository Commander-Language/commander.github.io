                When I was in elementary school,
                I went on a field trip to the Christa McAuliffe Space Center,
                where I was starstruck by their spaceship simulators;
                at the age of fourteen, I taught myself programming and made my own,
                and I hosted simulated missions at my middle school. <br/> <br/>

                I never stopped learning.
                Today, I'm a student in the BS/MS program,
                concurrently completing both my bachelor's and my master's degrees
                in Computer Science.
                My special interests lie in compiler engineering,
                programming language design, and language parsing.
                I even wrote my own compiler from scratch for a custom language specification,
                which is available <a href="https://github.com/caydenlund/jplc">on my public GitHub profile</a>.
                My dream job is to write compilers in a professional context. <br/> <br/>

                When I'm not busy saving the world or doing homework,
                I enjoy driving through long, winding canyons in my Miata
                and folding intricate origami models.
                The one I make the most is Tadashi Mori's Darkness Dragon. <br/> <br/>

                I’m a student at the University of Utah. I’m graduating in May
                2024 with a BS degree in Computer Science and a minor in
                Mathematics. I’ve been working as an intern (and will soon be a
                full-time engineer) at a smallish IT company known as TriVir. I
                have a lot of experience programming, beginning all the way back
                when I was 14 years old. I’ve worked on many projects since
                then. Big projects I’ve worked on include a self-solving 3D
                Rubik’s Cube program, the Commander Language project (my school
                capstone project), Frodo (ForgeROck DO, an open source project),
                and many other big projects I’ve worked on for various clients
                while working at TriVir. <br><br>

                Besides my interests in programming, I’m also interested in
                science, math, gaming, and puzzles, with my main hobby being
                gaming. I’m also an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ
                of Latter-day Saints, and served a mission for the church from
                June 2019 to April 2021 in Quito, Ecuador and Virginia, USA. As
                such, I’m fluent in the Spanish language. <br><br>

                I plan on working as a software engineer after I graduate. I may
                go on to graduate school if I find an area I’m particularly
                interested in studying. My ultimate goal is to eventually become
                a freelance programmer/indie dev so I may have the freedom to
                work on whatever project I want to.<br><br>

                Hello, my name is Jaden Gill! I am a computer science student enrolled at the
                University of Utah. I am expecting to graduate in May 2024. I was born into a
                Military family, so I have lived in many states during my childhood. My family
                and I moved to Utah in late 2015 and continue to live here today!<br><br>

                I initially desired to major in Architecture, but enrolled in Computer Science
                after taking some engineering courses. I am exploring many hobbies outside of
                programming, including sketching, painting, and hiking.<br><br>

                Some of my previous projects include a simple terrain generator, a mobile
                application, and a simple fuzzing application. I am currently working on
                Commander with my team members.<br><br>
